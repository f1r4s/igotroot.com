# Dorks are cool
### Dorks for Google, Shodan and BinaryEdge
Only for use on bug bounty programs or in cordination with a legal security assesment.

I am in no way responsible for the usage of these search queries.

Be responsible thanks - https://www.bugcrowd.com/resource/what-is-responsible-disclosure/


This repository is *"under construction"* feel free to make pull requests :-)


## Web services

*Example of how to fingerprint services with the different search engines:*

Service |Google | Shodan | BinaryEdge | CVE/Exploit
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
*Pulse VPN (RCE VULN)* | ``inurl:"/dana-na/"`` | ``http.html:/dana-na/`` | ``http.body:dana-na`` | *CVE-2019-11510*
*Horde Webamil (RCE VULN)*| ``inurl:/imp/login.php`` | ``html:"horde_login"`` | ``http.body:horde_login`` | *CVE 2018-19518*


*NOTE:* Some services have already been fingerprinted by Shodan and BinaryEdge and you can use the `product:` tag

**Examples:**

*BinaryEdge* - `product:"Pulse Secure VPN gateway http config"`

*Shodan* - `product:"Pulse Secure"`


## Random dorks


### Google
`inurl:%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2F` - Open redirect/SSRF/Local File Disclosure

### Shodan.io

*Some of these dorks are old as fuck just FYI :-)*

`hacked-router-help-sos` - Hacked routers :D

`NETSurveillance uc-httpd` - user:admin no passwords most likely

`NCR Port:"161"` - ATM's :-)

`HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect Location: /containers country:"US"` - Container Advisor dork

`html:"def_wirelesspassword"` - HTML tag looking for passwords in source of brazillian routers

`country:xx http.status:200 http.component:odoo port:8069` - After finding instances go to /web/database/manager most of the time there is either no password or it's "admin"

`Model: PYNG-HUB Crestron` - IoT 

`x-jenkins 200` - Internet facing Jenkins servers, some unauthenticated. :O
